### Running Cypress Tests

The ***npx cypress open*** command launches the Cypress Test Runner in interactive mode. This mode allows you to:

* **Run Tests Interactively:** Select and run individual tests or test suites manually.
* **Debug Tests:** View tests running in real-time, making it easier to debug and inspect their behavior.
* **View Test Results:** Access detailed results and logs for each test, including screenshots and videos if configured.

### Headless Mode
To run Cypress tests in headless mode, use the following command:
***npx cypress run --headless***

### Debug Mode
To run Cypress tests with debug logs, use the following command: DEBUG=cypress:* npx cypress run
