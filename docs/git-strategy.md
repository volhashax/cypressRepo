## Git Workflow Strategy

### Main Branch
The `main` branch contains the stable version of the project. All changes in this branch are thoroughly tested and approved.

### Feature Branch
Development work is done in feature branches. Each feature branch is created from the `main` branch and is named according to the feature being developed.
